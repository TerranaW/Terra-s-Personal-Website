        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> 
            Hey there! I'm Terra, a newcomer to the exciting world of web development. My journey into tech began when I made the difficult decision to leave my previous college. With some extra time on my hands, I stumbled upon a 10-day software engineering mini course. I had no idea what software engineering was, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to dive in. That experience opened my eyes to the vast possibilities in the tech world, and it wasn’t long before I found myself drawn to web development.

            During that time, I explored various courses, but web development stood out as something I could really connect with. The idea of building websites and bringing ideas to life online felt both challenging and rewarding. That interest led me to a bootcamp scholarship focused on web development, and I’m currently deep in the learning process. Every day, I’m gaining new skills and confidence in creating web applications, and I’m loving every minute of it.
